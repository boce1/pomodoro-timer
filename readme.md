Basic pomodoro timer

The idea reading duration of sessions and location of audio file from time.txt file
If file doesnt exist it is created
User can put location of audio file that represent audio file played after finished session.

Contols:
Pause/Unpause session -> SPACE
Restart session -> ENTER

There is sonic animation when timer is running, and animation while timer is sleeping.
